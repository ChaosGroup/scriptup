# About

This project provides ruby bindings for the SketchUp C API. They are designed to mimmic the SketchUp [**ruby api**](https://ruby.sketchup.com) for use in Sketchup extension tests outside the SketchUp application.  You can however use them for general purpouse scripting.

The SketchUp C API is much more limmited than the ruby api.  There is no gui event loop, nor observers, nor view, nor does this extension aim to provide such functionality.
